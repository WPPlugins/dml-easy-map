== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need to take a Google API to activate it? =

Because it is mandatory according to Google’s policy. Google Maps API allows you to display maps on your web site / applications. 25.000 view is available daily for standard (free) API. For more, you supposed to take a premium code.

= Is it possible to add more than one map on the same page? =

No, it's not possible currently. You can place only one shortcode on each page.

= Why it is not possible to customize map from the front end? =

For PHP and .NET versions, it's possible. But for Wordpress version, customization is possible via admin side because of the performance and security aspects. 

= How can I design a marker? =

Marker Editor offers 6 marker containers, color palette for container and 175 different type of icons. So, you can combine these 3 elements to create a marker.
